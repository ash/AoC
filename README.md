# Advent of Code

In this repository, I am collecting my solutions of the problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I started my participation in December 2020, but I ocasionally solve the tasks from previous years too. Most of the solutions are solved in the Raku programming language.

For the solutions of 2020, I am also posting comments to the code in my blog at [andrewshitov.com/category/advent-calendar-2020](https://andrewshitov.com/category/advent-calendar-2020/).
